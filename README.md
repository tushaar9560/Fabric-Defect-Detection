# Fabric-Defect-Detection
**Designed and implemented a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for accurate fabric defect detection. Employed Image segmentation to precisely identify and outline fabric defects, enhancing quality control processes. Tailored to the characteristics of fabric defects such as Stain, Coloured flecks, Broken pattern.**
